WIP indexer- adding features as I go.

Features implemented:  
- Fetching the nfts using alchemy api
- Fetching nft details using alchemy api
- Clean UI using React, bootstrap, and chakra
- Form validation checks for valid address using ethers library
- Toast message if form isn't valid or if there is another error with the alchemy api call

Planned features:
- Connect web3 wallet to check balances without typing address
- Maybe make some better cards to make it look just a bit prettier
- Light/dark mode switch
